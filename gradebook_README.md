In this assignment we are creating a Ruby on Rails app for managing teacher, student, and parent accounts by setting up a way for them to authenticate and login using email and passwords.

This is a two part assignment and in the first part we are setting up the account login page and getting it setup so a teacher can log in and create other teachers who will then be able to login.
